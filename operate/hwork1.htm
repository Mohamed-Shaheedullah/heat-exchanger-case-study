<H3>How Heat Exchangers Work</H3> 

Before selecting materials, it is important to understand the basic workings of a heat exchanger.
<P><P>
The purpose of a heat exchanger is to extract heat from a hot process fluid   and transfer it to a benign fluid such as water.
<P><P>
One fluid flows through the tubes, the other fluid flows through the shell  outside the tubes.

          A shell and tube heat exchanger is constructed of tubes that
          are attached on each end by a plate that the tubes goes through
          called a tube sheet.

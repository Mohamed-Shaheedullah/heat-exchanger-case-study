<H3>How Heat Exchangers Work</H3> 
<p>
Before selecting materials, it is important to understand the basic workings of a heat exchanger.

The purpose of a heat exchanger is to extract heat from a hot process fluid   and transfer it to a benign fluid such as water.

One fluid flows through the tubes, the other fluid flows through the shell  outside the tubes.

<p>
A shell and tube heat exchanger consists of a series of tubes, each of which is surrounded by a shell. The tubes are arranged in a bundle, and the shell is designed to allow the two fluids to flow past each other without mixing.
The hot fluid flows through the tubes, while the cold fluid flows around the tubes in the shell. 
</p>
<p>
The internal area where the tubes are located is enclosed by a shell or enclosure.

                    Heat is transferred from the hotter to the cooler fluid.

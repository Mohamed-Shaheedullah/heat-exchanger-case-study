# Heat Exchanger Interactive Case Study
## Introduction
In 1996 I coded an interactive  heat exchanger case study in HTML and JavaScript for my Corrosion MSc project.  Obviously a lot has changed since then.  I am now updating this case study with help of AI.  This is essentially a "vibe-coding" update.  
## The Case Study
The original case study was a paper based exercise given by a corrosion scientist from a chemical company.  I asked my supervisor if I could implement it for the web.  I used some of the materials from the paper exercise and implemented some of my own ideas along with some suggestions from my supervisor.
